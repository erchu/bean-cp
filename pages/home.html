		Today modern applications usually contain more than one object model of the same real-life objects. The reason behind that
		approach is need for model optimization for specific use or system modularization. For example,
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model">domain model</a> is used to organize your application logic and is mapped to
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">view models</a> optimized for UI layer</li>. Another example are
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">data transfer objects</a> optimized model for transferring data over
		network and integration between systems using technologies like WebServices.
	</p>

	<p>The drawback of this approach is need for extra mapping code to map data between models. In fact those models are usually similar,
	so writing mapping code could be really boring. This is why mapping frameworks were invented. <strong>Bean-cp is object to object mapping
	framework for Java.</strong> Library is targeted for Java version 8 to bring the power of lambas to object mapping.</p>
